# Data processing

process.py will process all the data, and handle importing scripts for every folder in the `raw` directory.

process.py will produce all the normalisation and cleans up the data.

```
python process.py
```

# Configuration

config.py defines how the data is handled by process.py

You can define what folders to take in, how every file is treated, and how they are outputed
