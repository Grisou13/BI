You see the obstacles to get to a cloud-based infrastructure as an opportunity to learn.You share knowledge with your Tech Development colleagues to make them self-sufficient. Better teach a man to fish than to give him one, right?You stay cool when things break. You search for the root cause and don’t stop until you find it. Once you do, you make sure this can’t fail again.You don't wait for things to come to you. You go out and get them. You're self motivated, communicative and get things done.You work together, because you like to learn from your colleagues. You coach your team members and provide them with honest feedback.You have your own opinion and you’re able to voice it in a constructive discussion.TeamYou will be part of the “e-commerce deployment” team: a team consisting of smart, experienced and highly motivated engineers who want to take our IT Development department to the the next step in cloud infrastructure. The engineers in this team know everything about the systems of our web platform.  Your team will be supported by a Team Lead, Product Owner and a Scrum Master. A day at the officeDuring the stand-up, you agree to work with Jamie (our cloud expert) on moving some domains to Route 53. The configuration is not complex, but you need to call with our current hosting provider. It's a bit of a challenge as it is hard to get the right information about what they are doing and when. However, you work closely with them and together you get it done by lunch.In the afternoon you talk to the Product Content development team and discuss how we can migrate the queue that they are using for product reviews. It's now an on-premise RabbitMQ, but since we are moving to the cloud, you recommend using SQS. You discuss different options for implementation with the team and agree to join them next sprint for a few days to get the SQS solution into production.At the end of the day, Frank (senior developer from your team) demonstrates the new solution for the assets of the website. They are now being served from an S3 bucket, with CloudFront caching in front of it. It works great, so we’ll take it into Production next week. After that, it's time to go out and have a nice specialty beer. You do check your beers in Untappd, right?What we're askingYou are smart and have some way to prove it.You are awesome with Linux. You can inspect that package, debug that firewall rule, you know why that file permission is 0600 and where those inodes went. Or you are similarly awesome from a Windows perspective.You are strong with configuration management tools like Puppet, Chef, or Ansible.You believe in configuration management - if it’s not managed, it’s not real.You know scripting and have development experience in Python, Ruby or plain old Bash.You “automate all the things” from bootstrap to backup.You have a DevOps mindset with a strong drive to get things done.

We love open-source. We are a very international team with interesting people from all over the world (95% of us have relocated to Berlin).How we workWe strongly believe in the importance of uninterrupted time to get stuff done and quality over quantity when it comes to working hours. We prefer to keep our schedule meeting-light and work in a library-like atmosphere during the core hours.We believe the ability to give and get constructive feedback and express divergent ideas is crucial to make innovation come to life. We live a very open discussion culture and prefer the evaluation of ideas based on merit over top-down decision making.We strongly believe in ownership of one's features, from spec to implementation to operation. We also understand that ownership comes with a sense of responsibility towards others that depend on the results of our work.We believe that that everybody should be able to find meaning in their work. We match assignments based on both ability and individual interests and discuss your progress and individual needs every 3 months.We don't see people as "resources" and genuinely care about each other. We also understand that there's more than fancy perks and cool events to people's satisfaction and engagement. We continuously work towards an environment providing a lot of autonomy, transparency and development opportunities and rely on everybody's feedback to hold us accountable for maintaining our high standards.About the interview processHow we get to know each otherWe like to start out with a brief 20-30min session for a mutual introduction. We tell you about our company, product and culture and are happy to answer any questions you might have. From your side, we're mostly interested in understanding what kind of challenges you're looking for, what technologies you'd like to work with and what role you'd like to be in.If both sides agree that this could be a good fit, we move on to a more technical session. We ask you to walk us through one of your past projects as if we were new colleagues joining you on the job. The ability to communicate effectively and concisely about complex systems and trade-offs between different approaches is key.In a second technical session, we discuss some of the technologies and concepts you have used. We also give you a walk-through of our product and solutions, discuss our architecture and components. Finally we try to scope your initial role and focus — should you be joining us.In the last session, we discuss the remaining details, logistics and plan your relocation.We see the interview process as a mutual opportunity to get to know each other — at eye level. That's why we won't ask you to work for free on any coding assignments and always strive for responding within hours, not weeks.

Develop and retain our people by fostering a positive environment for personal and professional development through continuously engaging with developers, appraisals, objectives and training plans. Provide a platform for developers to raise concerns or offer new ideas, support one another, and resolve conflict, and where necessary manage performance or disciplinary concerns. Promote and develop the key values from our Ways of Working, including innovation, trust and openness.Continuous improvement. Drive continuous improvement and adoption of best practices within the software development team to optimize the performance of the team. By pragmatically weighing the business need for delivery with the need to keeping technology current, help to ensure the team is producing the right solution at the right time.Documentation. Define and own the good practice for technical documentation, demos, and handovers amongst the team for the benefit of colleagues, and customers requiring technical API documentation.Technology. Support your team in ensuring they are abreast of the latest developments in technologies, and they have the tools they need to adopt appropriate technology. Be familiar with the current technologies in your team, and be aware of upcoming technologies. You do not need to be the technology expert within your team, but must be able to articulate the pros and cons of competing technologies and justify investment to senior management.Quality Assurance. Work very closely with the Quality Assurance Manager to ensure QA practices are aligned across the department, particularly in the adoption of Test Automation and the Test Automation Engineers reporting to the QA Manager.Workload.

Core Data has an opening for two (2) experienced senior-level C++ programmers to add to our EU-based remote work team.  This work-from-home contract style position offers a full time opportunity to each developer selected for the position.  Candidates selected for this position will work under a full-time independent contractor relationship with our EU-based division.C++ is the main programming language used on company projects; however, candidates are expected to be "full stack" and have experience in web APIs, web services, JSON, etc, since nearly all of our in-house applications either produce or consume web services.  Many of the services we interact with are undocumented or legacy code, so patience and investigative skills to determine how a given remote API works and how to extract the needed information from it are of the highest importance.  Many projects will involve creation of web bots, crawlers, or automatic web scraping programs to gather data from specified sites or endpoints.For this position, emphasis is placed on the applicant's ability to produce solutions with minimal outside help.  As this is a senior-level position, all applicants are expected to be able to write the required applications from start to finish, including design of any database queries or tables.  Design specifications will be provided for each project prior to commencement.  While actual programming ability is one of the key requirements of this position, applicants for this senior-level posting are expected to show initiative and take a practical approach towards solving real-world problems.Most of the applications developed at Core Data are related to data feeds for sports odds, betting, and statistics.

You will be working on our customers’ web application UIs – from sketching the first mockups to placing the last finishing touches.A day in the Design teamYou arrive at the office exceptionally early today, at 8.15. There’s a good reason for the early rise: it’s time to gather around the table with your fellow designers for the Design team’s weekly show and tell. This is a great opportunity to get a glimpse of what everyone’s working on at the moment, and have some feedback of your work as well. You give some valuable feedback of contrast issues to a colleague in San José, and in return receive some tips on how to simplify the DOM of one of your web components, to allow easier styling in CSS.After the meeting is over, you take a moment to check on your various Slack channels.

This means you can finally finish a feature you’ve been iterating over with a developer for the past few days.After the project team’s daily stand up, your work on the app’s responsive design continues. The app is rather data-heavy at places, and you have been working closely with the project’s UX designer to find new ways of presenting the content on different screen sizes.

Your experience of delivering first class systems in a first class way combined with strong technical abilities and even stronger soft-skills will give you the initial credibility and allow you rapidly gain the trust required for managing the deliveries with no line-management responsibilities.You value Agile and Lean principles and are able to find the right tools and techniques (they all have their limits and use cases) for each and every situation — as they all are different. You are not dogmatic and you act with an open mind — as you value a collaborative working environment and don’t want to stifle it or raise communication or relationship walls.The Director of Software Engineering ResponsibilitiesEnsure the features as defined in the product roadmaps are delivered according to their priorities and plans. Tip: you can and should influence the roadmap, like everybody else.Build and maintain a (positive) sense of urgency. This should result in a stimulating, dynamic work climate where everyone feels motivated by the challenges and the pace of deliveries.Ensure a self-selected team is created for each feature, and that this team has the skills and availability required for the delivery.Take a proactive role in growing and shaping the team.Organise and build project/resource plans and reports fitted to the needs of the R&D; team.Working with the CTO on continuously improving our software engineering and delivery processes and organisation.As the owner of the delivery, you will ensure that they are built to an appropriate level of quality, and that the internal requirements in terms of traceability, code quality through coding conventions, static analysis, automated testing and deployment and finally documentation are met. Notwithstanding the appropriate level of quality, your experience will also allow you to avoid the opposite common flaws such as over-engineering, gold-plating. You know what “good-enough” means for each feature, which allow you to release the feature as soon as it’s ready (not sooner, and not later).The high-level view of the feature will allow you to guide the team into building simple, functional features while avoiding building another Rube Goldberg machine — which can happen when highly skilled people iterate rapidly on something without keeping the big picture in mind.You understand that tools and systems which end up in the hands of customers or partners need to have a certain level of polish and hence you will act as the gate-keeper where only features having reached that level will be submitted to the product managers for validation.RequirementsMinimum 15 years of experience building and delivering business critical software, preferably as dev team / team lead.Passionate about technology and engineering.Strong track record of delivering complex engineering projects spanning multiple teams and domains.Strong organisational skills, ability to manage short term, urgent deliverables along with planning and building for the long term.Comfortable working in a fast paced environment, rapidly growing team, and under minimal supervision.Experience working in a distributed fashion, with remote locations (nice to have, but definite plus).Mastery of XP and Lean Startup concepts and practices (nice to have, but definite plus).Very good oral and written English.
Java/Spring Technical Editor (remote, part-time) at Baeldung () (allows remote)
We're looking for a part-time Java/Spring Technical Editor to work with new authors.You'll be guiding authors by reviewing their articles and giving them technical feedback (in video form - usually a short, 5 minute screencasts is enough).Budget and Time CommitmentOverall, you’ll spend 12-14 hours/month and the budget is 600$/month.This corresponds to a target of 12 - 16 articles/month (12 x 1250 words or 16 x 1000 words articles).The typical article will take about 2 rounds of review until it’s ready to go. All of this usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes of work for a small to a medium article and can take 60 to 90 minutes for larger pieces.Additional DetailsThe goal is to make sure that the article hits a high level of quality before it gets published.That means that the code examples should be runnable and correct and that the formatting and style match the guidelines of the site.Who is the right candidate?First – you need to be a developer yourself, working or actively involved in the Java and Spring ecosystem. All of these articles are code-centric, so being in the trenches and able to code is instrumental.Second – you need to be able to provide feedback via screencasts. These videos are informal - generally, just a quick review explaining what author needs to improve on their article.Finally – and it almost goes without saying – you should have a good command of the English language.

UI/UX, Application, and Website Designer For 16-Person All-Remote SaaS Company at Action Verb () (allows remote)
Hi! We’re Action Verb.We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower organizations worldwide.Our products include BrickFTP, a hosted file sharing service for business, and Vae Platform, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.Our company consists of 15 (but growing to 19 by the end of the year) full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America.Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.Our Success StrategyWe’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.We Practice HolacracyWe are one of the early adopters of Holacracy, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations. As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time."Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations."– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder & CTOHolacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE→We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&L; Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT→Our team members work from home and choose their own hours, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.Design Skills We’re Looking ForThis position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) designComprehensive understanding of UI/UX principlesSolid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.Some of Our Core BeliefsWe believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills. We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire. We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work. Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb. Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure. We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.We believe that engineers should support what they build. We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS→Salary and PayAs you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work. Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.Ready To Apply?Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you, please apply.We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs? Is there anything you would add or change?Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?Are you familiar with Holacracy?

Complex Systems Engineer in a well-funded startup at OnTruck (Madrid, Spain)
The challengeThe road transportation industry has been stuck in the same way of doing things for the past 30 years, with complex over-the-phone transactions that could be sped up and more efficient using the right technology. Figuring our product out and getting users to switch is a tough challenge and we want your insights and experience.The teamEvery one of us has had several start-up experiences and on average we have 10+ years of experience in somehow similar challenges. We know success, we know failure; we've built platforms from scratch, we've dealt with large legacy systems. We care about each other and about the product we're building.Some of the past projects where our engineers have been involved before joining OnTruck are: building the billing system for one of the largest telephony operators in Spain, building up and optimising complex marketplaces handling millions of orders a month, building real time video chats, building a global oauth/identity provider, improving the garbage collector of the JVM, creating social network libraries even before Facebook existed, building the Eurofighter simulator used to train pilots, building kernel modules to deal with real-time processor allocation, creating NLP algorithms to score user comments and timeline recommendation algorithms, building software to manage a backbone network, building the mobile apps of tier 1 banks, building mobile e-readers for millions for users, integrating mobile apps with Arduinos and dealing with the logistic platform of a big supermarket chain.Investors like our concept and team and we've been quite successful in fundraising and gathering resources to support our future growth.The engineering cultureWe value speed of iteration and best practices and we care about our craft: both our API and key components have 100% test coverage, for instance.We get engineers as close to the business problems as possible, so everybody is involved in solution design. We have mechanisms to enable anybody in the company to bring their new ideas to decision makers since we believe that innovative ideas come from everywhere.The stackWe have a decoupled architecture, based on REST APIs and asynchronous services. We work with React in the frontend platforms (customers and admin), native in mobile apps (truck drivers), Python/Django in the transactional backend and Elixir for real-time functional needs. Our DB is PostgreSQL and the queues run on RabbitMQ.We use a dedicated ERP (Odoo) to avoid reinventing the wheel there and we also have built a DWH/Analytics platform which takes advantage of external solutions.What we offerAn office in the former Palacio Miraflores in the center of Madrid.A laid-back culture where everybody is encouraged to participate in discussions and contribute.Opportunities for personal growth and learning (we hold regular tech talks and encourage working on different parts of the platform).Good salaries and stock options packages. We want our engineers to have ownership and participate in company success.Flexible schedule (though no regular remote working since we believe in face-to-face communication).

Static Object Lead Developer at Bonanza.com (Seattle, WA)
Since the dawn of software development, the ongoing struggle of Lead Developers and CTOs has been to time-efficiently understand what their team is working on, and somehow differentiate between the output of their most productive developers and the rest. It has long been assumed that the problem is just too hard -- coding & commit styles vary tremendously between individual Developers, and attempting to build a tool that can understand what's happening in the code would require teaching an algorithm to "think" like an experienced Developer. And yet, that is the tool we've built. Now we need you to join us and take this tool to the next level.Is this an important enough problem? Here's what a top result from Google (from Dev9) has to say about it:"If there is a holy grail of the technology industry, especially from a management standpoint, it's the measurement of developer productivity. You can't plan if you can't measure. If you believe [you can solve this problem], you'll be a wealthy rockstar of the programming universe. People will write books about your life and your brilliance." Sounds good to us.DetailsThis role will be a hybrid individual contributor and leadership position that will initially be tilted toward individual contributions, but grow increasingly toward team leadership over time. As an individual contributor, you will help to create a system that can interpret code as you do. This means identifying additions, deletions, updates, find and replace, et. al. Armed with a well-defined concept of how code is changing over time, you'll leverage this data to help build a better diff viewer than Github (not a high bar), a means for grouping similar commits, and a collection of visualizations that make it fast and, dare we say fun, to see how a repository changes over the course of a sprint. As the Lead Developer, you'll help define the roadmap for what features can make CTOs, Lead Developers, and individual contributors more productive. You'll use intuition, a sophisticated test suite, and machine learning to map lines of code back to the features and bugs they implement. Since this is a nut that has never been cracked by another company, you'll be given significant latitude to take your creativity and channel it into the implementation of a product that should become essential to developer productivity across organizations.You will work closely with the CEO, VP of Product, and other departments to coordinate the development of Static Object with our business objectives. You will join us in dogfooding this product daily, to ensure that we're building toward a direction that solves real world needs.Job Requirements5+ years experience as a Developer in a high level language like Ruby, Python, or C#5+ years experience using gitStrong background in architecting large-scale systems, taming complexity using DRY principlesWork with the CEO to formulate the optimal set of tools to reliably measure+improve quality over timeInterface with clients on an as-needed basis to ensure that we are serving their needsHandy with a variety of debugging techniques, never been content to settle for debugging via log statementsDemonstrated grit and optimism in the face of great challengePreferred: Experience with high-level programming concepts, like AI and machine learningPreferred: Consuming passion for software development, including history of contributing to side projects outside one's day job

If you're too busy with something more important either assign it to someone else or set a reminder to come back to it later.ALWAYS LEARNING - Be willing to learn whatever technologies, tools, or patterns necessary to solve a problem.
